## Description

Basic portfolio website with flexbox, media query, and CSS variable. 


Overview:
* The page presents my name, and links to sections about me, me work, and how to contact me
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications
* When presented with my first application then that application's image is larger in size than the others
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
